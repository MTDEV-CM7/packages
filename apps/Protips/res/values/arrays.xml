    <!-- Set of tips to show the user.

         First line is the tip title, which is shown in bold on its own line.

         All subsequent text is placed into the tip body.

         The occurrence of @drawable/foo causes the bitmap drawable named "foo"
         to be displayed to the right of the tip text.

         Example for tip #1:
